This project studies rat sightings across NYC from NYC Open Data's 311 request data with exploratory data analysis and visualization.

It aims to answer three questions:

Question 1: How has the number of 311-reported rat sightings in NYC changed over time? How does this trend differ across different boroughs and location types?

Question 2: Which regions of NYC have the most rat sightings? How does that change across location types?

Question 3: What factors influence whether a 311 request for a rat sighting is marked as closed?

In order to reproduce the plots in this project, download the CSV from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe and the shape file from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Modified-Zip-Code-Tabulation-Areas-MODZCTA-/pri4-ifjk. Edit the file paths in results.qmd to match where you have stored those files locally. Then, run results.qmd.
