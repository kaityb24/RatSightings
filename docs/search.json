    "text": "1 Introduction\nAs most residents know, there is a large and increasing rat population in New York City. In fact, it has been estimated that the rat population is now up to 3 million in 2023 (1). There has also been increasing discussion of the city’s rat problem in the media and by political figures. In April, Mayor Adams announced that there would now be a citywide director of rat mitigation (or “Rat Czar”) and appointed Kathleen Corradi to the position with the goal of reducing the city’s rat population (2). This announcement was also accompanied by a $3.5 million investment towards rat reduction work specifically in Harlem (2). As Corradi expressed, “Rats are a symptom of systemic issues, including sanitation, health, housing, and economic justice” (2).\nGiven this, it is clear that having a better understanding of NYC’s rat problem through data analysis and visualization is insightful and important to better understand inequities across the city. Additionally, with these new rat mitigation initiatives being implemented, having more information and insights about the current rat population will be useful to establish baseline trends. Those baseline trends could be re-evaluated and compared against in the future to better understand the effect of these rat migration initiatives. Finally, there are public health ramifications to NYC’s rat problem. A study conducted by Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health identified dangerous pathogens such as Salmonella, C.difficile, and E. coli on NYC rats (3). These pathogens can be left behind by rats by their saliva, urine, or feces, putting humans and their pets at risk of disease (3). The summary of the study also stresses that there is still much unknown about the public health risk of rats to humans and that monitoring of the rat population is needed to prevent dangerous public health situations like the rat-caused Black Death from occurring in the future (3). Clearly, identifying trends in NYC’s rat population through data analysis and visualization is incredibly useful from a public health standpoint.\nWith the NYC Open Data Rat Sightings dataset, we will be able to address many questions about NYC’s rat population. In which parts of NYC is the rat population most and least prevalent, and how has that changed from 2010 to 2023? How do rat sightings differ between commercial, residential, and outdoor settings? Are rat sighting 311 service requests more or less likely to be closed in certain neighborhoods or settings? How has the proportion or NYC rat sighting 311 requests that are closed changed over time? How do seasons affect rat sightings? These questions and others can be answered by analysis and visualization of this dataset.\nSources:\n\nhttps://mandmpestcontrol.com/there-are-now-3-million-rats-in-new-york-city-study/\nhttps://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/249-23/mayor-adams-anoints-kathleen-corradi-nyc-s-first-ever-rat-czar-#/0\nhttps://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/rats-new-york-diseases-they-carry"

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\n\n2.1.1 About the data:\nThis is the New York City Rat Sightings Dataset, collected from NYC Open Data.\n\nLink to Data Source: NYC Rat sightings dataset\n\nThe data comes from 311 service requests and we imported the data directly from the link above using NYC Open Data’s csv API, downloaded onto our local system and then used it for the analysis.\n\n\n2.1.2 Data update frequency on the website:\nEveryday 9AM EST. This dataset contains various columns representing different aspects of rat sightings in New York City from 2010 to present day and is updated daily on the NYC Open Data Platform.\n\n\n2.1.3 Descriptive stats about the data:\nThe data has 31 features with 232,536 rows. We have not detailed all the 31 features but instead only the ones which will be mainly used for our analysis. An overall description of the features is given in the data addendum section.\n\nCreated Date: The date and time when the sighting report was created. This will be important for a time series analysis of the dataset.\nAgency, Agency Name: The agency responsible for handling the sighting report. The only agency here in the dataset is the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene. This shall not be used much for the analysis.\nLocation Type [loc_type]: The type of location where the sighting occurred. This categoric feature has 23 levels. Each level can be used to split the data for analysing indepth trends.\nIncident Zip [zip]: The ZIP code where the sighting occurred. Used for geospatial analysis of the data.\nAddress Type [add_type]: The type of address provided for the sighting. There are 6 levels in this categoric feature Intersection, Address, Blockface, Placename, Latlong, Unrecognized.\nCity [city]: The city area where the sighting occurred. While this feature is named city, it is actually areas in New York City where the sighting occurred. This is a categoric feature with 62 levels. We have identified the % distribution of data in each level and slice the data accordingly in the analysis.\nStatus [status]: The current status of the sighting report. This has 7 levels - Pending, Closed, Assigned, In-Progress, Open, Draft, Unspecified.\nDue Date [due]: The due date for resolving the report.\nBorough [bor]: The borough in which the sighting occurred. This has 6 levels Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx, Staten Island and Unspecified.\nLatitude [lat]: The latitude of the sighting location. Used for geo-spatial mapping of sightings.\nLongitude [long]: The longitude of the sighting location. Used for geo-spatial mapping of sightings"
